# Volcano Dataset Project: Data Analysis in Python

## Introduction

This project aims to perform data analysis on volcanoes using the Python programming language. To achieve this, we will make 8 questions about volcano activity and in each question we will use different model types (for instance: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, graph, correlation analysis and linear regression) to obtain a result. The analysis will provide valuable insights into the geographical distribution, types of eruptions, and other patterns associated with volcanoes.

## Dataset

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/volcano-eruptions
<br><br>
The dataset used contains the following columns:

- **volcano_number:** Volcano ID.
- **volcano_name:** Name of the volcano.
- **primary_volcano_type:** Primary classification.
- **Last Eruption:** Date of the last recorded eruption.
- **country:** Country where the volcano is located.
- **region:** The broader geographic area where the volcano is located within the country.
- **subregion:** The specific area within the region where the volcano is located.
- **latitude:** The north-south geographic position of the volcano.
- **longitude:** the east-west geographic position of the volcano.
- **elavation:** The height of the volcano above sea level, indicating how high it rises in the landscape.
- **tectonic_settings:** The tectonic configuration in which the volcano is situated, such as "subduction," "rift," "intraplate," etc.
- **evidence_category:** Categories indicating the evidence of volcanic activity, such as "historical," "Holocene," "Pleistocene," etc.
- **major_rock_1, major_rock_2, major_rock_3, major_rock_4, major_rock_5:** The primary types of rock associated with the volcano, which may include basalt, andesite, dacite, rhyodacite, etc.
- **minor_rock_1, minor_rock_2, minor_rock_3, minor_rock_4, minor_rock_5:** The additional or secondary types of rocks associated with the volcano.
- **population_within_5_km:** Population Living Within a 5-Kilometer Radius of the Volcano.
- **population_within_10_km:** Population Living Within a 10-Kilometer Radius of the Volcano.
- **population_within_30_km:** Population Living Within a 30-Kilometer Radius of the Volcano.
- **population_within_100_km:** Population Living Within a 100-Kilometer Radius of the Volcano.



## Tools Used

- **Jupyter or Google colab:** Both of them was used to create the data analysis and run the code.
- **Python:** Primary programming language.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For graphical visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building machine learning models.

## Conclusion

This project aims not only to explore data about volcanoes but also to provide valuable insights for researchers and authorities responsible for monitoring volcanic activity. The combination of exploratory analysis, graphical visualizations, and predictive modeling will offer a comprehensive understanding of this complex natural phenomenon.
